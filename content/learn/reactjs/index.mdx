# Modern React.js

Welcome to the Modern React.js tutorial series — a structured and evolving guide designed for developers who want to go beyond just writing components and learn how to build production-ready, scalable React applications. This series is being written as I actively revisit and deepen my own understanding of React. Whether you're learning React for the first time or returning to it after a break, you're not alone in the process — I'm right there with you.

As I explore key concepts, patterns, and tooling, I document what I find most helpful, including the questions that arise and the real-world context that brings clarity. Each section builds on the previous, gradually introducing advanced features like state management with Redux, performance optimization techniques, robust testing strategies, and deployment workflows. The goal is not just to teach React, but to develop confidence in using it across the entire software development lifecycle — from local development to production deployment.

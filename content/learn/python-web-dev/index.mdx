# Python Web Development

Welcome to the **Python Web Development Tutorial Series**.
This series is designed for **mid-level developers** who already have a strong foundation in Python and want to expand into building **scalable, production-ready web applications**.

By the end of this series, you will have:

* A deep understanding of both **FastAPI** and **Django** frameworks.
* Hands-on experience with **databases** (SQL & NoSQL), **asynchronous programming**, and **background tasks**.
* Exposure to **modern deployment strategies**, including Docker, serverless, and cloud-native practices.
* A complete **capstone project**: a **Personal Finance App** that integrates all the concepts into one cohesive, production-ready application.

## Who Is This Series For?

This series is targeted at developers who:

* Already know **Python basics** (variables, functions, classes, modules).
* Have some experience with **web development** (REST APIs, HTTP, frontend/backend separation).
* Want to learn how to **design, test, deploy, and scale** web apps in real-world scenarios.
* Aim to transition into **backend, full-stack, or cloud engineering roles**.

If you’ve already completed the [Python Foundations Series](/learn/python/) in this tutorial project, you’re ready to dive in.

## What You’ll Build

Throughout the chapters, you’ll develop:

* A **FastAPI Todo API** → learning async, REST, and database integration.
* A **Django Blog Application** → mastering full-stack patterns with models, views, and templates.
* Integrations with **databases, caching, background tasks, and observability**.
* **Capstone Project** → A **Personal Finance App** with reports, AI insights, and dashboards.

Each application builds on the last, ensuring you **learn by doing**.

## Structure of the Series

1. **Section 1: Introduction to Web Development with Python**
   * Lays out the roadmap and project overview.
2. **Section 2: FastAPI — APIs and Async Backends**
   * Build APIs, add authentication, persistence, and async tasks.
3. **Section 3: Django — Full-Stack Development**
   * Create server-rendered apps, forms, templates, and dashboards.
4. **Section 4: Databases and Data Modeling**
   * Relational (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis).
5. **Section 5: Async and Background Tasks**
   * Async programming with FastAPI, Celery, and task queues.
6. **Section 6: Building Scalable Applications**
   * Config management, testing, packaging, deployment.
7. **Section 7: Advanced Topics and Trends**
   * Cloud-native apps, serverless, event-driven, AI integrations.
8. **Capstone Project**
   * A **Personal Finance App** combining everything.

## Learning Approach

Each chapter includes:

* **Explanations** of key concepts.
* **Code examples** with detailed commentary.
* **Diagrams** to visualize workflows.
* **Tests** using Pytest and pytest-django.
* **Quizzes** to reinforce learning.
* **Case studies** to connect theory to practice.

## What You Need Before Starting

* **Python 3.11+** installed.
* Familiarity with **Poetry**, **pytest**, and **mypy** (we use them throughout).
* Comfort with the **command line** and **basic Git workflows**.
* Optional: Docker installed (for deployment sections).

## Next Steps

* Begin with **Chapter 1: Introduction to FastAPI**.
* Clone the series starter repository.
* Work through each section progressively.

You are now ready to start your journey into **Python Web Development**. This series is structured as a **guided bootcamp**, taking you from fundamentals to advanced, cloud-ready applications — and ending with a **production-quality capstone project** you can showcase.

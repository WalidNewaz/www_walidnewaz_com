# Git Mastery Series

This series is a hands-on journey into Git—not just as a tool for version control, but as a foundational part of the modern development and DevOps lifecycle. Whether you're writing backend services, managing infrastructure as code, or collaborating on large-scale systems, understanding Git at a deep level is critical. This series aims to demystify Git from the ground up, using practical, real-world examples and a single evolving project to ground the concepts.

The chapters are written progressively, often alongside my own learning and deep dives into Git's more advanced areas. As a result, the content is grounded in genuine problem-solving scenarios—questions I’ve asked, edge cases I’ve run into, and workflows I’ve refined. Each section is designed to not only explain how Git works, but also to help you think through why it works that way, and how to use it confidently across development, testing, deployment, and operations.

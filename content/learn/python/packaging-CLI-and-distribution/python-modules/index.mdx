# Chapter 17: Using 3rd Party Python Modules, and Publishing Your Own Modules

Python’s true power lies in its vast ecosystem of third-party packages, enabling developers to quickly build applications without reinventing the wheel. This chapter will teach you how to:

* Install and use third-party packages from PyPI
* Understand dependency and version management
* Explore popular third-party modules

## 17.1 Installing and Using 3rd Party Modules

Python comes with a **batteries-included** philosophy — its standard library provides modules for files, networking, math, concurrency, and more. However, real-world development almost always requires **third-party packages**: reusable libraries published by other developers to **extend Python’s capabilities**.

Examples include:

* **Requests** for making HTTP requests.
* **Pandas** for data analysis.
* **Flask / FastAPI / Django** for building web apps.
* **Pydantic** for data validation.
* **Numpy** for numerical computing.

These libraries are distributed through the **Python Package Index (PyPI)** and installed using **pip**, Python’s package manager.

### Installing Packages with pip

To install a package, use the `pip install` command:

```bash
# Install the popular "requests" HTTP library
pip install requests
```

This will:

1. Download the latest version of `requests` from PyPI.
2. Install it into your current Python environment.

### Specifying Versions

For reproducibility, it’s often better to lock versions:

```bash
# Install exactly version 2.28.1
pip install requests==2.28.1

# Install any version >=2.0 but <3.0
pip install "requests>=2.0,<3.0"
```

### Importing and Using Installed Modules

Once installed, you can use the module with a standard `import`:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print("Status code:", response.status_code)
print("Headers:", response.headers["content-type"])
print("Body:", response.json())
```

Here:

* `requests.get()` performs an HTTP GET request.
* `.status_code` gives the HTTP status (e.g., 200 for success).
* `.json()` parses JSON responses into Python dictionaries.

## 17.2 Virtual Environments for Dependency Isolation

If you install everything globally, dependencies from different projects can **conflict**. For example, one project may need `Django==3.2` and another `Django==4.1`.

**Virtual environments** solve this by isolating dependencies per project.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the folder `.venv`
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Mac/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Now all installs will be isolated
pip install requests
```

Deactivate the environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```

### `requirements.txt`

Projects typically declare dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
requests==2.28.1
pandas>=1.5,<2.0
fastapi
```

Install all at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This makes projects reproducible for other developers.

### Pipfile and Pipenv

Traditionally, Python projects used `requirements.txt` for dependency management. While simple, it lacks support for environments, dev dependencies, and reproducible builds. **Pipenv** improves this by introducing the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

#### Pipfile: Key Features

* `Pipfile`: replaces `requirements.txt`, splitting dependencies into `[packages]` and `[dev-packages]`.
* `Pipfile.lock`: ensures **reproducibility** with pinned versions and hashes.
* Built-in support for **virtual environments**.
* Simplifies dependency resolution.

#### Example: Pipfile

```cs
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
requests = "*"
pydantic = "2.11"

[dev-packages]
pytest = "8.4"

[requires]
python_version = "3.10"
```

#### Pipfile: Usage

```bash
# Install pipenv
pip install pipenv

# Install dependencies
pipenv install

# Install dev dependencies
pipenv install --dev pytest

# Spawn shell in virtualenv
pipenv shell

# Deactivate the environment
deactivate
```

#### Why It Matters

* Cleaner than raw `requirements.txt`.
* Tracks both human-readable intent (`Pipfile`) and machine-pinned reproducibility (`Pipfile.lock`).
* Common in teams/projects that want lightweight but structured dependency management.

### Poetry

<a href="https://python-poetry.org/" target="_blank">Poetry</a> is a modern dependency manager and packaging tool for Python, widely adopted for libraries and applications.

#### Poetry: Key Features

* Uses `pyproject.toml` as its single source of truth.
* Handles dependencies, virtual environments, packaging, and publishing to PyPI.
* Provides lockfile (`poetry.lock`) for reproducibility.
* Supports semantic versioning (`^`, `~`, exact pins).

#### Example: pyproject.toml with Poetry

```cs
[tool.poetry]
name = "myapp"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An example Python app using Poetry"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
requests = "^2.31"
pydantic = "^2.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^8.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

#### Poetry: Usage

```bash
# Install Poetry
pip install poetry

# Create new project
poetry new myapp

# Install deps (creates venv automatically)
poetry install

# Add a dependency
poetry add fastapi

# Run code inside poetry venv
poetry run python main.py

# Publish to PyPI
poetry publish --build
```

#### Why It Matters

* All-in-one: dependency management + build + publish.
* Preferred by many OSS maintainers.
* Reduces boilerplate (no `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `MANIFEST.in` mess).

### `pyproject.toml` (PEP 518 and beyond)

PEP 518 introduced **`pyproject.toml`** as the **unified build system config file** for Python projects. It’s now the **standard entry point** for tool configuration (like Black, Ruff, Mypy, Poetry, Flit).

#### Key aspects of `pyproject.toml`

- **Centralized Configuration:** It serves as a single source of truth for various project configurations, replacing older methods like `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`.
- **Build System Definition:** The `[build-system]` table specifies the tools required to build the project, such as `setuptools` or `hatchling`.
- **Project Metadata:** The `[project]` table contains essential metadata about the project, including its `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `authors`, and `dependencies`.
- **Tool-Specific Settings:** The `[tool]` table allows for configuring settings for various development tools like linters (e.g., Ruff, MyPy), formatters, or package managers (e.g., Poetry).
- **Dependency Management:** It defines project dependencies within the `[project.dependencies]` or `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` sections, including optional dependencies for development or testing.
- **Standardization:** Introduced by PEP 518, it promotes a consistent and predictable approach to Python project management, aligning with modern engineering principles.

#### Example: `pyproject.toml`

```cs
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "finance-app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Personal Finance CLI app"
authors = [{ name = "Walid Newaz", email = "walid@example.com" }]
dependencies = ["requests", "pydantic"]

[tool.black]
line-length = 100

[tool.ruff]
select = ["E", "F"]
ignore = ["E501"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
strict = true
```

#### Usage

```bash
# Build a package from pyproject.toml
pip install build
python -m build

# Install a project (PEP 660 editable installs)
pip install -e .
```

#### Why It Matters

* **Future-proof**: PEP-backed standard across Python ecosystem.
* One file to configure **all tools + build metadata**.
* Adopted by Poetry, Flit, Hatch, Setuptools.

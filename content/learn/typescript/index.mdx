Welcome to Mastering TypeScript — a practical and progressively developed tutorial series aimed at developers who want to build a strong, working knowledge of TypeScript from the ground up. This series is being created as I learn and revisit TypeScript myself. As I explore and reinforce my own understanding of how TypeScript improves safety, scalability, and clarity in modern JavaScript codebases, I’m documenting the most important lessons, patterns, and practices along the way.

The content is intentionally structured to mirror a developer’s real journey — starting from the fundamentals of types, interfaces, and modern JavaScript integration, then moving into tooling, frameworks, advanced type features, and architectural best practices. You’ll find that each section builds upon what came before, with a focus on clean examples, gradual complexity, and real-world application. Whether you're new to TypeScript or returning after some time, this series is designed to be approachable, iterative, and immediately useful.

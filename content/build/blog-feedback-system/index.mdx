# Building a Blog Feedback System - From Prototype to Full-Stack


This series shows you how to add feedback mechanisms to your blog or app in small, incremental steps.
You’ll start with no-code prototypes (Airtable), move into third-party integrations (Giscus/Disqus), and finally build your own full-stack custom feedback system with analytics and ML.

The goal is not only to teach you how to implement feedback systems but also to demonstrate the iterative process of going from prototype → product.

## Audience

Developers (mid-level and up).

Familiar with basic Python/JS, React/Gatsby, and REST APIs.

Interested in learning both quick hacks and scalable implementations.

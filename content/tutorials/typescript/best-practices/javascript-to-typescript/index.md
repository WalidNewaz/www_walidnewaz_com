# Refactoring JavaScript Codebases to TypeScript: A Step-by-Step Guide

Migrating a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript can significantly improve the maintainability and robustness of an application by introducing strong typing and catching errors at compile time. However, this transition involves more than just renaming `.js` files to `.ts`. This guide provides a structured approach to refactoring JavaScript codebases to TypeScript, highlighting common issues, pitfalls, and useful tools to streamline the process.

## Step 1: Prepare the Environment

### 1. Install TypeScript

Add TypeScript to your project using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

### 2. Initialize TypeScript

Generate a `tsconfig.json` file which is the configuration file for TypeScript.

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

This file controls how TypeScript is compiled. You can start with the defaults and adjust them as necessary.

### 3. Install TypeScript Definitions

For projects using libraries (like React, Lodash), install the TypeScript type definitions. These are available for most popular libraries.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/lodash
```

## Step 2: Start Small

### 1. Rename Files

Start by renaming small components or utility files from `.js` to `.ts` (or `.tsx` if they contain JSX for React).

### 2. Fix Initial Errors

TypeScript will likely identify type errors immediately. Begin by addressing these errors. This might involve annotating types or fixing genuine bugs revealed by TypeScript.

## Step 3: Gradually Expand Scope

### 1. Move Outward from Initial Files

Refactor files that interact closely with the ones already converted to TypeScript. This gradual expansion helps manage the complexity of changes.

### 2. Use `any` Sparingly

Initially, you might be tempted to use `any` type to bypass TypeScriptâ€™s strict typing. Use it sparingly; otherwise, you negate the benefits of moving to TypeScript.

## Step 4: Refactor and Integrate

### 1. Refactor Code

As you convert files, take the opportunity to refactor the code. Improve type usage by creating interfaces and types where beneficial.

### 2. Integrate with Build Tools

Ensure your build tools and scripts are updated to handle TypeScript. For example, if using Webpack, configure the TypeScript loader.

## Step 5: Optimize TypeScript Configuration

### 1. Tighten TypeScript Rules

As your team becomes more comfortable with TypeScript, gradually tighten the rules in `tsconfig.json`. For instance, enable `strict` mode to enforce stricter type checking.

### 2. Continuous Integration

Update your CI/CD pipelines to include TypeScript compilation checks, ensuring that type errors are caught during the build process.

## Common Pitfalls and Issues

### 1. Large Codebases

- **Incremental Adoption**: In large projects, convert the codebase incrementally to manage risk.
- **Module Resolution Issues**: Refactoring can reveal hidden cyclic dependencies or improper module resolutions.

### 2. Third-party Libraries

- **Missing Types**: Some libraries might not have type definitions. You may need to write custom declarations or contribute to DefinitelyTyped.
- **Outdated Types**: Occasionally, type definitions lag behind the library updates.

### 3. Runtime Behavior

- TypeScript types are stripped away at runtime. Ensure that runtime checks (e.g., checking for `null` or `undefined`) are still in place.

## Automation Tools and Services

### TypeStat

[TypeStat](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat) is a CLI tool that can modify existing JavaScript and TypeScript to improve types. It can add missing types and fix implicit `any` types automatically.

To get started enter the following command:

```bash
npx typestat
```

This will create a new `typestat.json` configuration file. Now use the following command to convert all your files:

```bash
typestat --config typestat.json
```

To get a deeper understanding about how TypeState works, please visit the official [TypeStat website](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat).

### dts-gen

`dts-gen` is a CLI tool that generates TypeScript definition files (.d.ts) from any JavaScript code. Use `dts-gen` to generate starter TypeScript declaration files for JavaScript libraries that do not have type definitions.

To get started enter the following command:

```bash
npm install -g dts-gen
```

To generate the type definition file for a JavaScript package, so that it can be used within a TypeScript project, enter the following in your command line:

```bash
dts-gen -m {package-name}
```

For additional information and more command line options, please review the `dts-gen` [official website](https://github.com/microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools/tree/main/packages/dts-gen).


### TypeScript ESLint

Leverage TypeScript-specific linting rules with ESLint to maintain high code quality and consistency across the converted codebase.

For additional information about how to setup eslint, and tutorials, please review the [official website](https://eslint.org/).

## Conclusion

Converting a JavaScript project to TypeScript is a significant undertaking, especially for large codebases. However, the benefits of type safety, improved developer tooling, and early detection of errors make this effort worthwhile. By following a structured approach, leveraging automation tools, and adjusting development processes to include type checks, teams can ensure a smooth transition to TypeScript.

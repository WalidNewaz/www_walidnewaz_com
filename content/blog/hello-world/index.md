# Hello World!

It’s 2023, and I’ve just started blogging! It seems like I’m a little late to the party doesn’t it? Well, I have been meaning to write on a blog for some time now. I had contemplated submitting my work to Medium and Substack in the past. I could get a few people to read my thoughts and ideas that way.

However, as a software developer, I would miss out on the aspects of websites that get me most excited; experiencing the creation and maintenance of a website site. I wanted to experience the process of building a blog site from scratch with some modern, light-weight web frameworks, managing it on a cloud platform, and driving traffic into the website. So, I decided to go on my own and build things from “scratch”. In a way, this is just as much about creating the blog site, as much it is about writing good blog posts.

I do write occasionally for personal notes, documentation or professional presentations. Most of them are stowed away in personal file systems, Google docs and corporate knowledge bases. They were either for my personal use, or for a very specific group of people, for specific times. They do not get reviewed and critiqued over time, as much as I would like.

However, the writing of my thoughts allowed me to convey ideas in a meaningful way, and learn simply by the act of doing it. I would like to reach a wider audience so that I can improve upon those. Therefore, I have decided to finally start blogging.

The purpose of my writing for this blog is not to profit, or to gain popularity, but rather to become a better communicator. I would hope that in sharing my thoughts and ideas, I would receive honest and hopefully helpful feedback from people who read my posts.

Along the way I hope to research many topics on technology, write about as many things that pique my interest, learn and grow as a professional and as a human.

#Hello World!

It’s 2023, and I’ve just started blogging! It seems like I’m a little late to the party doesn’t it? Well, I have been meaning to write on a blog for some time now. I had contemplated submitting my work on Medium and Substack. However, as a software developer, I wanted the experience of creating and maintaining a personal blog site. I wanted to experience the process of building a blog site from scratch with some modern, light-weight web frameworks, and managing it on a cloud platform. So, in a way, this is just as much about creating the blog site, as much it is about writing good blog posts.

I do write occasionally for personal notes, documentation or professional presentations. Most of them are stowed away in personal file systems, Google docs and corporate knowledge bases. They were either for my personal use, or for a very specific group of people, for specific times.

The writing of my thoughts allowed me to convey ideas in a meaningful way, and learn simply by the act of doing it.

The purpose of my writing for this blog is not to profit, or to gain popularity, but rather to become a better communicator. I would hope that in sharing my thoughts and ideas, I would receive honest and hopefully helpful feedback from people who read my posts.

Along the way I hope to read a lot on many topics on technology, write about as many things that pique my interest, learn and grow as a professional and as a human.
